# Brackeys Godot Tutorials - C# Version

* This organization contains C# versions of Brackeys Godot tutorials (since they decided to go with GDScript).
* All credit for the projects goes to Brackeys.
* Only those projects and tutorials with a sufficiently permissive license can be translated (as forks whenever possible).

> This organization is *not* affiliated with Brackeys and only aims to provide additional value for their work - free of charge, for everyone, just like Brackeys does.
